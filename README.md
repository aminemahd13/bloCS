# 2048 Games Project

## Overview
This project is part of our coding week at CentraleSupélec, where we are tasked with developing various versions of the classic **2048 game** in Python. The project explores innovative twists to the original gameplay, offering multiple versions with unique rules, designs, and objectives. 

The project's repository can be accessed through the school’s GitLab: [2048 Project Repository](https://gitlab-cw1.centralesupelec.fr/paolo.ballarini/jeu2048/-/tree/main).

## Project Description
The **2048 Games Project** expands on the original **2048 game**, a puzzle game in which players combine tiles to reach a goal tile, typically 2048. We have designed multiple game variants, each introducing new mechanics and challenges to enhance the gameplay experience.

### Objectives:
1. Develop multiple Python-based 2048 versions, each with unique gameplay rules.
2. Apply Python programming fundamentals and modular design practices.
3. Experiment with interactive game design using text and graphical interfaces.

## Game Variants

### 1. **Classic 2048**
   - The traditional game with a 4x4 grid, where the player’s goal is to merge tiles until they reach the 2048 tile.

### 2. **Time Attack 2048**
   - Players must reach 2048 within a time limit, adding urgency to the game.

### 3. **Hexagonal 2048**
   - A new hexagonal grid format introduces unique movement and tile-merging strategies.

### 4. **Reverse 2048**
   - Start with the 2048 tile and merge tiles down to a lower target number in a limited number of moves.

### 5. **Themed 2048 (e.g., Space Theme)**
   - A visual overhaul with a futuristic or space-inspired theme, adding animations and sound effects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- Recommended: **Virtual Environment** for dependencies

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab-cw1.centralesupelec.fr/amine.mahdane/cw-2048.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cw-2048
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project
To start a game variant, run the appropriate Python script:
```bash
python main.py
```
